# projectX
Names are hard and projectX name is dumb. At the time of creating this repo, there was no tangible project we are working towards, so till then we will keep it as Project X. 

# Git manners
I am not able to protect the main branch as it requires us to switch to the paid version of github. So, we will follow honest code and not fiddle around with pushing commits to master. 

### 
Branch naming convention
 - branch should follow the name - user/<firstname>/issue_number-description.e.g. "user/mario/01-gpio"
